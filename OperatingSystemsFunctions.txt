The first OS function that I wanted to talk about was microsoft disk operating system. Or commonly known as MS-Dos. This was the first operating system I learned to use, how to use it and had a huge "cheat sheat" of commands saved on a pieces of paper. Thinking back on it, maybe this is what first interested me in coding. 
The second OS function that I would like to talk about is windows alt-tab. This is a must have function for windowed operating systems. If you're only running a single monitor, switching back and forth between different windows can be done without touching the mouse. 
The third OS function that I would like to talk about is apples multi touch. Using an iphone is very intuitive, but that was not by accident. All of the features built into the phone are simply amazing, and allow people to pick up a phone and simply use it without thinking at all, zooming in or out on a photo, scrolling on a website, swiping left or right to see the next photo. These are all freatures built into the multi touch.
