The first operating system function that I wanted to talk about was microsoft disk operating system. Or commonly known as MS-Dos. This was the first operating system I learned to use, how to use it and had a huge "cheat sheat" of commands saved on a pieces of paper. Thinking back on it, maybe this is what first interested me in coding. 
The second operating system function that I would like to talk about is windows alt-tab. This is a must have function for windowed operating systems. If you're only running a single monitor, switching back and forth between different windows can be done without touching the mouse.
